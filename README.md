# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I created this program in order to learn the beginnings of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. This webpage will provide the foundational skills necessary in my path to becoming a developer. I learned the importance of repetition and diligence in creating a website. In addition to the outlook knowledge, I also learned about the basics of those four aforementioned topics, as well as ancillary things like proper use of VSCode and where to go to learn more about confusing topics, like JavaScript.
